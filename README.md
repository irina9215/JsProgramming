Advance Praise for Head First JavaScript

Your brain on JavaScript. You’re sitting around trying to learn something,
but your brain keeps telling you all that learning isn’t important. Your brain’s saying,
“Better leave room for more important things, like which wild animals to avoid and
whether naked water skiing is a bad idea.” So how do you trick your brain into thinking
that your life really depends on learning JavaScript?
